The dispersion relation is $\omega^2 = gk\tanh kh$ where $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ is the angular frequency, $k = \frac{2\pi}{L}$ is the wave number, $h$ is the water depth, $L$ is the wave length and $T$ is the wave period.

Did tutorial on cli programs in rust and am now ready to start building the hands-on project.
